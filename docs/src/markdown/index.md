# About BracketHighlighter

## Overview

BracketHighlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `""`, `''`, `#!xml <tag></tag>`, and even custom brackets.

This was originally forked from pyparadigm's _SublimeBrackets_ and _SublimeTagmatcher_ (both are no longer available).  I forked his repositories to fix a number issues I add some features I had wanted.  I also wanted to improve the efficiency of the matching. Moving forward, I have thrown away all of the code and have completely rewritten the entire code base to allow for more flexibility, faster matching, and a more feature rich experience.
