# Customizing

## Overview

BH is extremely flexible and can be customized and extended to fit a user's needs.  The first step to customizing the existing rules and settings is to create a `bh_core.sublime-settings` in your `User` folder.  With this file you can override any of the settings or bracket rules.  By changing these settings, you can add support for new languages, or change the look of highlighting, and much more.

## Core Visual Settings

These are the settings related to the visual appearance of BH.

### `show_in_minimap`

Shows highlighted brackets in the minimap.  This will work with all highlight styles except `underline`; `thin_underline` has no issues.

```js
    // Show brackets in the minimap.
    "show_in_minimap": false,
```

### `show_unmatched`

Displays a special highlight for brackets that cannot be matched.

```js
    // When only either the left or right bracket can be found
    // this defines if the unmatched bracket should be shown.
    "show_unmatched": true,
```

### `show_unmatched_exceptions`

List of languages in which the `show_unmatched` option logic will be reversed.

```js
    // Do the opposite of "show_unmatched" for the languages listed below
    "show_unmatched_exceptions": [],
```

### `content_highlight_bar`

An experimental setting which can enable the display of a vertical bar that extends from the line containing the opening bracket to the line with the closing bracket.  Takes a boolean of `true` or `false`.  When [`align_content_highlight_bar`](#align_content_highlight_bar) is set to `false`, the bar will be shown on the first column regardless of indent level of the brackets.  When `align_content_highlight_bar` is set to `true`, the bar will be aligned at the bracket indent level.

```js
    // Experimental: Creates a visible bar at the beginning of all lines between
    // multiline bracket spans.
    "content_highlight_bar": false,
```

### `show_in_widgets`

An experimental setting that enables bracket highlighting in widgets (panels etc.).  By default, BH does not highlight any brackets in plain text which is what the majority of the widget text boxes are.  Regex search boxes are not plain text and *should* get bracket highlighting.

```js
    // Experimental: Allow bracket highlighter to search in widgets.
    // Most widgets use Plain Text which BH should ignore,
    // But regex find views views are usually regular expression
    // Which should be the only views to trigger BH.
    "search_in_widgets": false,
```

Output panels are widgets as well, but sometimes the widget flag gets removed from them (Sublime issue). So this flag may or may not affect the output panel depending on its state.  If you are a developer and wish to ensure an output panel that is created by your plugin does **not** have bracket highlighting, you can set the following setting to the view as `True`: `bracket_highlighter.ignore`.

### `align_content_highlight_bar`

Modifies the behavior of [`content_highlight_bar`](#content-highlight-bar) and draws the vertical content bar at the indentation level of the highlighted bracket, but there are some limitations:

- The content bar cannot extend through an empty line unless the bar is on the first column.  This is a limitation of the Sublime API.  Empty lines will cause a gap in the bar.

- The content bar will not be shown on a line where non-whitespace characters cross the bar.

```js
    // Experimental: Align the content highlight bar at the bracket indent level
    "align_content_highlight_bar": false,
```

### `high_visibility_enabled_by_default`

Enables high visibility mode by default.  High visibility mode highlights not only the bracket but the content between as well, but it is disabled by default and must be toggled on to be used.  This reverses the behavior and has it on by default. Takes a boolean `true` or `false`.

```js
    // Enable high visibility by default when sublime starts up
    "high_visibility_enabled_by_default": false,
```

### `high_visibility_style`

Modifies the styling of high visibility mode.  The available options are `solid`, `outline`, `underline`, `thin_underline`, `squiggly`, and `stippled`.

```js
    // High visibility style and color for high visibility mode
    "high_visibility_style": "outline",
```


### `high_visibility_color`

Modifies the high visibility color.  There are three types of settings you can use:

- `__default__` is a special reserved value which will use the color set in `bracket_styles`.  See [Configuring Highlight Style](#configuring-highlight-style) for more info.

- `__bracket__` is a special reserved value which will inherit the defined color of the highlighted bracket.

- Any valid scope found in your color scheme.

```js
    // Color for high visibility mode
    "high_visibility_color": "__bracket__",
```

## Behavioral Settings

These settings affect the matching behavior.

### `match_only_adjacent`

Causes BH to only match and highlight brackets when the cursor is adjacent to a bracket.

```js
    // Match brackets only when the cursor is touching the inside of the bracket
    "match_only_adjacent": false,
```

### `bracket_outside_adjacent`

Augments the matching behavior and will trigger matching when the cursor is adjacent to a cursor on the outside (not between the brackets).

```js
    // Outside adjacent bracket matching
    "bracket_outside_adjacent": true,
```

### `block_cursor_mode`

Experimental setting that modifies the bracket matching mode for block cursor.  The bracket matching mode is one that makes a little more sense to some people in regards to the visual representation of block cursors.  In this mode, brackets will match when the cursor is right before the bracket (or if using a block cursor, highlighting the character). So if you are someone that uses block cursors and find that toggling [`bracket_outside_adjacent`](#bracket_outside_adjacent) still doesn't quite match brackets how you would like, you can give this setting a try. It has also been mentioned that this makes sense with Vim.

When this setting is enabled, [`bracket_outside_adjacent`](#bracket_outside_adjacent) will be ignored.

```js
    // Experimental: Special matching mode for block cursor.
    // Essentially, this provides a matching mode that makes a little more
    // sense to some in regards to the visual representation of block cursors.
    // This will ignore "bracket_outside_adjacent".
    "block_cursor_mode": false,
```

### `ignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin`

Ignores the [`bracket_outside_adjacent`](#bracket_outside_adjacent) setting when running a plugin **if** the plugin sets `no_outside_adj` to `null` (`null` for JSON or `None` in Python).

```js
    // When "bracket_outside_adjacet" is set, and a plugin command explicitly sets
    // "no_outside_adj" "None" instead of "true" or the default "false",
    // this value will be used.
    "ignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin": true,
```

### `ignore_block_mode_in_plugin`

Experimental setting that ignores the [`block_cursor_mode`](#block_cursor_mode) setting when running a plugin **if** the plugin sets `no_block_mode` to `null` (`null` for JSON or `None` in Python).

```js
    // When "block_cursor_mode" is set, and a plugin command explicitly sets
    // "no_block_mode" to "None" instead of "true" or the default "false",
    // this value will be used.
    "ignore_block_mode_in_plugin": true,
```

### `bracket_string_escape_mode`

Depending on the setting, BH will either match sub-brackets inside strings with traditional string escape logic, or it will match sub-brackets in strings with regex escape logic.  Takes a string value of either `regex` or `string`.

```js
    // Set mode for string escapes to ignore (regex|string)
    "bracket_string_escape_mode": "string",
```

### `search_threshold`

Sets the search threshold.  The search threshold determines how many characters BH will search through to find matching brackets before giving up.  This setting only affects auto-matching and not on-demand calls from the command palette and menu. By default, this value is very conservative and can be increased.  Keep in mind that a very large value may impact performance.

```js
    // Character threshold to search
    "search_threshold": 5000,
```

### `ignore_threshold`

Causes the [`search_threshold`](#search_threshold) limit to be ignored.  It is not advised to use this as very large files may cause a noticeable performance hit, but has been made available due to a number of requests.

```js
    // Ignore threshold
    "ignore_threshold": false,
```

### `auto_selection_threshold`

A numerical value which controls the maximum number of simultaneous auto-matched brackets that are allowed.  This setting will not be considered when running on-demand calls via the command palette or menu.

```js
    // Set max number of multi-select brackets that will be searched automatically
    "auto_selection_threshold" : 10,
```

### `kill_highlight_on_threshold`

Completely kills highlighting when [`auto_selection_threshold`](#auto_selection_threshold) is exceeded.  When disabled, BH will just highlight up to the threshold limit.

```js
    // Enable this to completely kill highlighting if "auto_selection_threshold"
    // is exceeded.  Default is to highlight up to the "auto_selection_threshold".
    "kill_highlight_on_threshold": true,
```

### `no_multi_select_icons`

Disables gutter icons when doing multiple selections.

```js
    // Disable gutter icons when doing multi-select
    "no_multi_select_icons": false,
```

## Popup Settings

Settings related to the new popup hints when brackets are offscreen.

### `show_offscreen_bracket_popup`

Setting this will show a popup when the mouse hovers over a visible bracket and its matching pair is offscreen.  The popup will show about 120 chars of context for every line shown.  Additionally, if the offscreen bracket is located on a separate line, it will show an additional line(s) of context before and after.  The context is shown in plain text, but the bracket will be emphasized by making the bracket bold and colorizing it with the your theme's keyword color.  [Character context](#popup_char_context), [line context](#popup_line_context), and [emphasis color](#popup_bracket_emphasis) can all be configured in the settings file.

![popup1](images/popup1.png)

![popup2](images/popup2.png)

If a bracket was unmatched with an invalid highlight, you can mouse over it and will get the unmatched popup that explains the reasons why an unmatched bracket might occur.  It also offers the option to attempt matching without the threshold.

![unmatched popup](images/unmatched_popup.png)

```js
    // Show hover popup
    // This will show a hover popup when mousing over
    // the visible bracket if the other
    // highlighted matching bracket is off screen.
    // It will show line text of the off screen bracket -/+ 128 chars
    // from the bracket start and end points.
    // A link will be available allowing the user to click and jump to
    // the other bracket.
    "show_offscreen_bracket_popup": false,
```

### `popup_char_context`

This determines the amount of characters per line of context that are allowed in the popup that is generated by [`show_offscreen_bracket_popup`](#show_offscreen_bracket_popup).  By default, this setting is set to `120`.  If you desire a different amount, you can specify it here.

```js
    // Adjust char per line context of bracket popup.
    "popup_char_context": 120,
```

### `popup_line_context`

Setting this determines the amount of additional lines of context that are allowed in the popup that is generated by [`show_offscreen_bracket_popup`](#show_offscreen_bracket_popup).  `popup_line_context` is only applied to brackets that are not on the same line as the visible bracket. This value is split and half the lines will be gathered from before the line of interest and half from after the line of interest.  It is recommend to use even numbers.  Line context is a bit dynamic in the sense that if **X** number of lines cannot be gathered from before, the additional lines will be applied after; the inverse is true in regards to lines after.

```js
    // Adjust number of lines of additional context
    // that are shown when brackets are vertically off screen.
    // Specified line count is split to context before and after the target line.
    // So a value of 4 would give you two lines of context before and two lines after.
    "popup_line_context": 2,
```

### `use_custom_popup_bracket_emphasis`

This experimental setting allows you to override the default popup bracket emphasis which is calculated based on what scope/color you have assigned to the matched bracket style.  With this setting enabled, you can use the setting [`popup_bracket_emphasis`](#popup_bracket_emphasis) to control the color of the popup bracket emphasis.  This will default to `true` if you don't have the MdPopups version which supports guessing the correct color.

```js
    // Use 'popup_bracket_emphasis' to customize the popup's bracket emphasis color
    "use_custom_popup_bracket_emphasis": false,
```

### `popup_bracket_emphasis`

This setting dictates what color is used to emphasize the off screen bracket in the popup that is generated by [`show_offscreen_bracket_popup`](#show_offscreen_bracket_popup).  Colors can either be specified by a standard [TextMate scopes][scopes] (the popup library being used is MdPopups, and it scans your theme for standard TextMate scopes and creates the necessary CSS for the popups), or you can specify a hex color in the form of `#rgb` or `#rrggbb`.  Due to limitations in Sublime's HTML renderer, scopes that define background colors will most likely not show the background color.  The default setting is `#ff0000`.

Outside of the scopes generated by MdPopups, it is likely that your theme may have additionally included scopes.  Sublime seems to include these by default (but your mileage may vary):

- error
- deleted
- success
- inserted
- warning
- modified

```js
    // Specify the scope (to get color) to emphasize the off screen bracket
    // in popups.  Alternatively you can use a hex value in the form '#rgb' or '#rrggbb'.
    "popup_bracket_emphasis": "keyword"
```

## Special Settings

### `debug`

Turn on debug logging.  Set to `true` to enable or `false` to disable.

```js
    //Debug logging
    "debug_enable": false,
```

### `upgrade_dependencies`

This sets whether BH will attempt to upgrade dependencies to the know latest on package upgrade.  If this is undesirable for any reason (development or you just don't like things upgrading without your explicit say so), then set this to `false`.

```js
    // Try to ensure dependencies are up to date.
    // If it is not desirable to have this done (like developing) on a specific dependency,
    // or some other reason, set this to False.
    "upgrade_dependencies": true,
```

## Tag Plugin Settings

This section covers settings found in `bh_tag.sublime-settings`.  All tag settings are dictionaries.  Each key represents a tag mode such as: `html`, `xhtml`, `cfml`, etc.  All of these are exposed so that even non-standard HTML syntax can be supported.

!!! warning "Attention!"
    More tag mode keys can be added, but they **must** be added to **every** setting with valid parameters.

### `tag_mode`

A list that contains a dictionary of different modes.  Each mode tweaks the tag matching for the respective mode.  Each entry in the list consists of a dictionary with the keys `mode`, `syntax`, and the optional `first_line`. `mode` specifies the mode name.  `syntax` is a list of languages that are allowed in that mode. `first_line` (which is optional) is a regular expression that is applied to the first line in the file as a condition for selecting that mode.  The `tag_mode` list is evaluated in order from top to bottom and selects the first entry that matches all the criteria.

```js
    // Determine which style of tag-matching to use in which syntax.
    "tag_mode": [
        {"mode": "xml", "syntax": ["XML"]},
        {
            "mode": "xhtml",
            "syntax": [
                "HTML",
                "HTML 5",
                "PHP",
                "HTML (Jinja Templates)",
                "HTML (Jinja2)",
                "HTML (Rails)",
                "HTML (Twig)",
                "HTML (Django)",
                "laravel-blade",
                "blade",
                "Handlebars",
                "AngularJS",
                "Java Server Pages (JSP)"
            ],
            "first_line": "^[ \\t]*<\\?xml"
        },
        {
            "mode": "html",
            "syntax": [
                "HTML",
                "HTML 5",
                "PHP",
                "HTML (Jinja Templates)",
                "HTML (Jinja2)",
                "HTML (Rails)",
                "HTML (Twig)",
                "HTML (Django)",
                "laravel-blade",
                "blade",
                "Handlebars",
                "AngularJS",
                "Java Server Pages (JSP)"
            ]
        },
        {
            "mode": "cfml",
            "syntax": ["HTML+CFML", "ColdFusion", "ColdFusionCFC"]
        }
    ],
```

### `tag_style`

Sets the highlight style for the tag plugin.  The string value should correspond to a style entry in `bracket_styles`.  See [Configuring Highlight Style](#configuring-highlight-style) for more info.

```js
    // Style to use for matched tags
    "tag_style": {
        "xhtml": "tag",
        "html": "tag",
        "cfml": "tag"
    },
```

### `tag_scope_exclude`

Excludes certain scopes from being evaluated when searching for tags.

```js
    // Scopes to exclude from tag searches.
    "tag_scope_exclude": {
        "xhtml": ["string", "comment"],
        "html": ["string", "comment"],
        "cfml": ["string", "comment"]
    },
```

### `optional_tag_patterns`

Specifies a regex pattern for names that will be evaluated as optional tags. Optional tags are tags whose closing tag is optional. In the case of optional tags, you may only have an opening (with no self closing slash). `null` can be used to specify that there is no pattern for the specified tag mode.

```js
    // Optional closing HTML tags. You can use 'null' if it does not require a pattern.
    "optional_tag_patterns": {
        "xml": null,
        "xhtml": null,
        "html": "colgroup|dd|dt|li|options|p|td|tfoot|th|thead|tr",
        "cfml": "cf.+|colgroup|dd|dt|li|options|p|td|tfoot|th|thead|tr"
    },
```

### `void_tag_patterns`

Specifies a regex pattern for names that never have a closing tag.  Void or empty tags can optionally use the self closing slash: `<tag />`. `null` can be used to specify that there is no pattern for the specified tag mode.

```js
    // Tags that never have a closing.  You can use 'null' if it does not require a pattern.
    "void_tag_patterns": {
        "xml": null,
        "xhtml": null,
        "html": "area|base|basefont|br|col|embed|frame|hr|img|input|isindex|keygen|link|meta|param|source|track|wbr",
        "cfml": "area|base|basefont|br|col|embed|frame|hr|img|input|isindex|keygen|link|meta|param|source|track|wbr"
    },
```

### `self_closing_tag_patterns`

Specifies a regex pattern for tag names that can be represented in self closing form: `<tag />`.  `null` can be used to specify that there is no pattern for the specified tag mode.

```js
    // Self closing tags.  Single tags that are closed like this <tag />
    "self_closing_tag_patterns": {
        "xml": "[\\w:\\.\\-]+",
        "xhtml": "[\\w:\\.\\-]+",
        "html": null,
        "cfml": "cf.+"
    },
```

### `tag_name`

Specifies the regex pattern for identifying the tag name for a given tag mode.  This is broken out as a separate pattern because the Tag Attribute Select `bh_plugin` needs access to the tag name and tag attributes separate from the whole HTML tag regex.

```js
    // Regex for tag name. Do not use capturing groups.
    "tag_name":
    {
        "xhtml": "[\\w:\\.\\-]+",
        "html": "[\\w:\\.\\-]+",
        "cfml": "[\\w:\\.\\-]+"
    },
```

### `attributes`

Specifies the regex pattern for identifying the tag attributes for a given tag mode.  This is broken out as a separate pattern so that because the Tag Attribute Select `bh_plugin` needs access to the tag_name and tag attributes separate from the whole HTML tag regex.

```js
    // HTML attributes.  Do not use capturing groups.
    "attributes":
    {
        "xhtml": "[\\w\\-:]+(?:\\s*=\\s*(?:\"(?:\\.|[^\"])*\"|'(?:\\.|[^'])*'))?",
        "html": "[\\w\\-:]+(?:\\s*=\\s*(?:\"[^\"]*\"|'[^']*'|[^\\s\"'`=<>]+))?",
        "cfml": "[\\w\\-\\.:]+(?:\\s*=\\s*(?:\"[^\"]*\"|'[^']*'|[^\\s\"'`=<>]+))?"
    },
```

### `start_tag`

Specifies the starting/opening tag regex.  The pattern can accept the tag name and attribute portion of the pattern from the [`tag_name`](#tag_name) and [`attributes`](#attributes) settings via the python string formatting variables `tag_name` and `attributes` (see example below).

```js
    // Regex for start/opening tag.  Use a capturing group for tag name and self closing indicator '/' only.
    // Attributes and tag names are inserted using python string formatting:
    // the keyword 'attributes' and `tag_name` are used.
    "start_tag": {
        "xhtml": "<(%(tag_name)s)(?:\\s+%(attributes)s)*\\s*(/?)>",
        "html": "<(%(tag_name)s)(?:\\s+%(attributes)s)*\\s*(/?)>",
        "cfml": "<(%(tag_name)s)(?:(?:\\s+%(attributes)s)*|(?:(?<=cfif)|(?<=cfelseif))[^>]+)\\s*(/?)>"
    },
```

### `end_tag`

Specifies the ending/closing tag regex.

```js
    // Regex for end/closing tag.  Only use a capturing group for name.
    "end_tag": {
        "xhtml": "</([\\w\\:\\.\\-]+)[^>]*>",
        "html": "</([\\w\\:\\.\\-]+)[^>]*>",
        "cfml": "</([\\w\\:\\.\\-]+)[^>]*>"
    }
```

## Swap Brackets Plugin Settings

Swappable brackets for a given language can be defined in `bh_swapping.sublime-settings`.  Swap rules are found under the key `swapping` where `swapping` is an array of language swap rules.

```js
    "swapping": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "language_list": ["C++", "C"],
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "entries": [
                {"name": "C/C++: #if", "brackets": ["#if ${BH_SEL}", "#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #if, #else", "brackets": ["#if${BH_SEL}", "#else\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #if, #elif", "brackets": ["#if${BH_SEL}", "#elif ${BH_TAB:/* CONDITION */}\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifdef", "brackets": ["#ifdef${BH_SEL}", "#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifdef, #else", "brackets": ["#ifdef${BH_SEL}", "#else\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifndef", "brackets": ["#ifndef${BH_SEL}", "#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifndef, #else", "brackets": ["#ifndef${BH_SEL}", "#else\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]}
            ]
        }
    ]
```

Each language rule contains the following attributes:

Attribute         | Type      | Description
----------------- | --------- | -----------
`enabled`         | bool      | Specifies if the rule is enabled.
`language_list`   | \[string] | An array of languages.
`language_filter` | string    | A string that specifies whether the `language_list` is either a `whitelist` or `blacklist`.
`entries`         | \[dict]   | An array of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes a type of bracket that can be swapped to.

The `entries` key is used to define the related bracket swap rules for the given language.  Each entry represents a bracket you can swap to.

Entry      | Type     | Description
---------- | -------- | -----------
`name`     | string   | The name of the entry as it will be seen in the command palette.
`brackets` | [string] | An array consisting of a string that represents the opening bracket and a string that represents the closing bracket.

Within the `brackets` key, you can specify where the cursor(s) will appear by using `${BH_SEL}`.  If you would like the selection to display text as a hint to what a user should enter in the selection, you can use `${BH_SEL:optional text}`.  You can also define tab stops that a user can tab through and enter text.  The tab stop syntax is `${BH_TAB}`.  You can also define optional text within a tab stop to give the user a hint of what should be entered using the following syntax: `${BH_TAB:optional text}`.

## Wrap Brackets Plugin Settings

Wrapping brackets for a given language can be defined in `bh_wrapping.sublime-settings`.  Wrap rules are found under the key `wrapping` where `wrapping` is an array of language wrap rules.

```js
    "wrapping": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "language_list": ["Plain text"],
            "language_filter": "blacklist",
            "entries": [
                {"name": "{} Curly", "brackets": ["{", "}${BH_SEL}"], "insert_style": ["inline", "block", "indent_block"]}
            ]
        }
    ]
```

Each language rule contains the following attributes:

Attribute         | Type     | Description
----------------- | -------- | -----------
`enabled`         | bool     | Specifies if the rule is enabled.
`language_list`   | [string] | An array of languages.
`language_filter` | string   | A string that specifies if the `language_list` is either a `whitelist` or `blacklist`.
`entries`         | [dict]   | An array of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes a type of bracket that can be used to wrap the selection.

The `entries` key is used to define the related bracket wrap rules for the given language.  Each entry represents a bracket you can wrap the selection with.

Entry          | Type     | Description
-------------- | -------- |------------
`name`         | string   | The name of the entry as it will be seen in the command palette.
`brackets`     | [string] | An array consisting of a string that represents the opening bracket and a string that represents the closing bracket.
`insert_style` | [string] | An array consisting of allowed insertion styles.  Allowed insertion styles are: `inline`, `block`, and `indent_block`.  Default is `#!js ['inline']`.

Within the `brackets` key, you can specify where the cursor(s) will appear by using `${BH_SEL}`.  If you would like the selection to display text as a hint to what a user should enter in the selection, you can use `${BH_SEL:optional text}`. You can also define tab stops that a user can tab through and enter text.  The tab stop syntax is `${BH_TAB}`.  You can also define optional text within a tab stop to give the user a hint of what should be entered using the following syntax: `${BH_TAB:optional text}`.

## Configuring Brackets

BH has been written to allow users the ability to define any bracket they would like to have highlighted.  Bracket rules are defined with case insensitive regular expressions, syntax scoping, and `bh_plugins`.  There are two kinds of brackets you can define.

1. [`scope_brackets`](#configuring-scope-brackets-rules) which search the file for scope regions and then use regex to test for opening and closing brackets.

2. [`brackets`](#configuring-brackets-rules) which use regex to find opening and closing brackets.

The `brackets` rules should usually be the preferred type.  `scope_brackets` are usually used for brackets whose opening and closing are the same. These type are not easily distinguishable from one another by regex. Scope brackets must be contained in a continuous scope region like `string` for quotes etc.

BH uses a wrapper around Python's re regex library to add support for additional back references.  See the [Extended Regex Guide](./extended-regex.md#extended-regex-guide).

!!! tip "Tip"
    Brackets can be modified, or even added, without copying the entire bracket rule list to the user settings.  See [Bracket Rule Management](#bracket-rule-management) for more info.

### Configuring Brackets Rules

Brackets are defined under `brackets` in `bh_core.sublime-settings`.

`angle` and `curly` brackets will be used as an example (not all options may be shown in these examples):

```js
        {
            "name": "angle",
            "open": "(<)",
            "close": "(>)",
            "style": "angle",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment", "keyword.operator"],
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["HTML", "HTML 5", "XML", "PHP", "HTML+CFML", "ColdFusion", "ColdFusionCFC"],
            "plugin_library": "bh_modules.tags",
            "enabled": true
        },
        {
            "name": "curly",
            "open": "(\\{)",
            "close": "(\\})",
            "style": "curly",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment"],
            "scope_exclude_exceptions": ["string.other.math.block.environment.latex"],
            "language_filter": "blacklist",
            "language_list": ["Plain text"],
            "find_in_sub_search": "true",
            "ignore_string_escape": true,
            "enabled": true
        },
```

Parameter                              | Description
-------------------------------------- | -----------
`name`                                 | The name of the bracket (should be unique).
`open`                                 | Defines the opening bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present).
`close`                                | Defines the closing bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present).
`style`                                | Name of the style definition to be used to highlight the brackets.  See *Configuring Bracket Styles* for more info.
`scope_exclude`                        | Scopes where the opening and closing brackets should be ignored.
`language_filter`                      | This works in conjunction with `language_list`.  It specifies whether `language_list` is a `blacklist` or `whitelist`.
`language_list`                        | An array of `tmLanguage` file names that should be avoided or included for highlighting.  Looks to `language_filter` to determine if avoidance or inclusion is used.
`enabled`                              | Disable or enable rule.
`scope_exclude_exceptions`\ (optional) | Used to ignore excluding of sub scopes such as in the curly example above where `string` is excluded, but not `string.other.math.block.environment.latex`.
`plugin_library`\ (optional)           | Defines a plugin to use for determining matches (see *Bracket Plugin API* for more info on matching plugins).
`find_in_sub_search`\ (optional)       | This rule should be included when doing sub bracket matching in `scope_brackets` (like finding round brackets between quotes etc.).  The setting must be a string and can be either `true`, `false`, or `only`; `only` means this bracket is only matched as a sub bracket of a `scope_bracket`.
`ignore_string_escape`\ (optional)     | Do not ignore sub brackets found in strings and regex when escaped, but use internal escape logic to determine if the brackets should be ignored based on whether regex or string escape mode is set.

### Configuring Scope Brackets Rules

Scope Brackets are defined under `scope_brackets` in `bh_core.sublime-settings`.

`py_single_quote` bracket will be used as an example (not all options are shown in this example):

```js
        {
            "name": "py_single_quote",
            "open": "u?r?((?:'')?')",
            "close": "((?:'')?')",
            "style": "single_quote",
            "scopes": ["string"],
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["Python"],
            "sub_bracket_search": "true",
            "enabled": true
        },
```

Parameters                   | Description
---------------------------- | -----------
`name`                       | The name of the bracket (should be unique).
`open`                       | Defines the opening bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present).
`close`                      | Defines the closing bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present).
`style`                      | Name of the style definition to be used to highlight the brackets.  See *Configuring Bracket Styles* for more info.
`scopes`                     | Scope that should be searched to find the opening and closing brackets.
`language_filter`            | This works in conjunction with `language_list`.  It specifies whether `language_list` is a `blacklist` or `whitelist`.
`language_list`              | An array of `tmLanguage` file names that should be avoided or included for highlighting.  Looks to `language_filter` to determine if avoidance or inclusion is used.
`sub_bracket_search`         | Specifies whether this scope bracket also searches for sub brackets (like curly brackets in strings etc.).
`enabled`                    | Disable or enable rule.
`plugin_library`\ (optional) | Defines plugin to use for determining matches (see *Bracket Plugin API* for more info on matching plugins).

### Bracket Rule Management

In the past, BracketHighlighter required a user to copy the entire bracket list to the user `bh_core.sublime-settings` file.  This was a cumbersome requirement that also punished a user because if they did this, they wouldn't automatically get updates to the rules as all the rules were now overridden by the user's settings file.

BracketHighlighter now lets you add or modify existing rules without overriding the entire rule set, or even the entire target rule.  Let's say you have a custom language you want to have on your machine. Now, you can simply add it to one of the two settings arrays: "user_scope_brackets" and "user_brackets":

```js
    "user_scope_brackets": [],
    "user_brackets": [
        {
            "name": "mylang",
            "open": "^\\s*\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\b",
            "close": "\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\b",
            "style": "default",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment"],
            "plugin_library": "User.bh_modules.mylangkeywords",
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["mylang"],
            "enabled": true
        }
    ],
```

Let's say you want to modify an existing rule, maybe just tweak the language list. All you have to do is use the same name of the item you want to change. Only that attribute will be overridden:

```js
    "user_brackets": [
        // Angle
        {
            "name": "angle",
            "language_list": [
                "HTML", "HTML 5", "XML", "PHP", "HTML (Rails)",
                "HTML (Jinja Templates)", "HTML (Jinja2)", "HTML (Twig)",
                "HTML+CFML", "ColdFusion", "ColdFusionCFC",
                "laravel-blade", "Handlebars", "AngularJS",
                "SomeNewLanguage" // <--- New language
            ]
        }
    ],
```

Let's say you want to insert a new rule between two rules. You can turn on debug mode and call the `BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key`, and then select `position` to see the current rule order and their position index.  To turn on Debug mode, just add `#!js "debug_enable": true` to your user settings file.

Example of `BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key` output:

```js
[
    [
        {"name": "curly", "position": 0},
        {"name": "round", "position": 1},
        {"name": "square", "position": 2},
        {"name": "html", "position": 3},
        {"name": "cfml", "position": 4},
        {"name": "php_angle", "position": 5},
        {"name": "angle", "position": 6},
        {"name": "cssedit_groups", "position": 7},
        {"name": "ruby_embedded_html", "position": 8},
        {"name": "ruby", "position": 9},
        {"name": "c_compile_switch", "position": 10},
        {"name": "php_keywords", "position": 11},
        {"name": "erlang", "position": 12},
        {"name": "bash", "position": 13},
        {"name": "fish", "position": 14},
        {"name": "mylang", "position": 15}
    ],
    [
        {"name": "py_single_quote", "position": 0},
        {"name": "py_double_quote", "position": 1},
        {"name": "single_quote", "position": 2},
        {"name": "double_quote", "position": 3},
        {"name": "jsregex", "position": 4},
        {"name": "perlregex", "position": 5},
        {"name": "rubyregex", "position": 6},
        {"name": "mditalic", "position": 7},
        {"name": "mdbold", "position": 8}
    ]
]
```

Then you can specify the position you want to insert at using the `position` key:

```js
    "user_scope_brackets": [],
    "user_brackets": [
        {
            "name": "mylang",
            "position": 4, // <-- New position
            "open": "^\\s*\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\b",
            "close": "\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\b",
            "style": "default",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment"],
            "plugin_library": "User.bh_modules.mylangkeywords",
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["mylang"],
            "enabled": true
        }
    ],
```

And if you run the debug command again, you will see that the position has changed:

```js
        {"name": "curly", "position": 0},
        {"name": "round", "position": 1},
        {"name": "square", "position": 2},
        {"name": "html", "position": 3},
        {"name": "mylang", "position": 4}, // <-- New position
        {"name": "cfml", "position": 5},
        {"name": "php_angle", "position": 6},
```

This can be used to adjust the position of default rules from your user settings as seen in the overrides above.

So, unless you are forking BH to pull request a change to the default rules, you can now modify the rules in just these two settings without copying or touching the default rules. This will allow you to make changes, but still receive new updated rules.

```js
    "user_scope_brackets": [],
    "user_brackets": [],
```

## Configuring Highlight Style

Each bracket definition (described in *Configuring Scope Brackets* and *Configuring Brackets*) has a `style` setting that you can assign a specific style to.  The name of the style corresponds to a style definition.  Style definitions are defined under `bracket_styles` in `bh_core.sublime-settings`.

There are two special style definitions whose names are reserved: `default` and `unmatched`, but you can configure them.  All other custom style definitions follow the same pattern.  All styles, even the *special* styles, follow the same format.  See description below:

```javascript
        // "default" style defines attributes that
        // will be used for any style that does not
        // explicitly define that attribute.  So if
        // a style does not define a color, it will
        // use the color from the "default" style.
        "default": {
            "icon": "dot",
            "color": "brackethighlighter.default",
            "style": "underline"
        },

        // This particular style is used to highlight
        // unmatched bracket pairs.  It is a special
        // style.
        "unmatched": {
            "icon": "question",
            // "color": "brackethighlighter.unmatched",
            "style": "outline"
        },
        // User defined region styles
        "curly": {
            "icon": "curly_bracket"
            // "color": "brackethighlighter.curly",
            // "style": "underline"
        },
        "tag": {
            "icon": "tag",
            // "endpoints": true,
            // "color": "brackethighlighter.tag",
            "style": "outline"
        },
```

Parameter  | Description
---------- | -----------
`icon`     | Icon to show in gutter. Available options are: `angle`, `round`, `curly`, `square`, `tag`, `star`, `dot`, `bookmark`, `question`, `quote`, `double_quote`, `single_quote`, `single_quote_offset`, `double_quote_offset`, `none`.
`color`    | Scope to use that defines the color.
`style`    | Highlight style.  Available options are: `solid`, `outline`, `underline`, `none`.  ST3 has additional styles: `thin_underline`, `squiggly`, `stippled`.
`endpoint` | Boolean to highlight just the beginning and end of bracket. This is useful for things like tags where it may be distracting highlighting the entire tag.

As shown in the example above, if an option is omitted, it will use the setting in `default`.  So `curly`, in this example, defines `icon`, but will use `default` for the `color` and `style`.

To customize the color for `curly` you can create your own custom scope.

Add this to your color scheme:

```xml
        <dict>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>Bracket Curly</string>
            <key>scope</key>
            <string>brackethighlighter.curly</string>
            <key>settings</key>
            <dict>
                <key>foreground</key>
                <string>#CC99CC</string>
            </dict>
        </dict>
```

And then use the scope:

```javascript
        "curly": {
            "icon": "curly_bracket"
            "color": "brackethighlighter.curly",
            // "style": "underline"
        },
```

### My personal configurations

If you are curious about my personal configuration, here it is. The color scheme I use (at the time of writing this) is from my [Aprosopo theme][aprosopo].

!!! note "Note"
    If a scope is not defined, it won't change the color. For instance, below I assign the hash rule for C/C++ preprocessors conditionals to `brackethighlighter.c_define`, but I don't have `brackethighlighter.c_define` in my theme `<dict>`. So it will look like the default color for this theme, which is white.

**My personal configuration: `bh_core.sublime-settings`**

```js
// Define region highlight styles
{
    "bracket_styles": {
        // "default" and "unmatched" styles are special
        // styles. If they are not defined here,
        // they will be generated internally with
        // internal defaults.

        // "default" style defines attributes that
        // will be used for any style that does not
        // explicitly define that attribute.  So if
        // a style does not define a color, it will
        // use the color from the "default" style.
        "default": {
            "icon": "dot",
            // BH1's original default color for reference

## Bracket Plugin API

There are two kinds of plugins that can be written:

1. `definition` plugins (plugins attached to bracket definitions via the `plugin_library` option).
2. `run instance` plugins (plugins that are that are fed directly into the BracketHighligher command via the command parameter `plugin`).

Bracket plugins use `BracketRegions`.

`#!py class BracketRegion(begin_pt, end_pt)`
: 
    `BracketRegions` are simple objects containing a begin pt and end pt of a bracket.

    **Parameters**:

    Parameter  | Description
    ---------- | -----------
    `begin_pt` | Starting point.
    `end_pt`   | Ending point.

    **Attributes**:

    Attribute | Description
    --------- | -----------
    `begin`   | The start point of the `BracketRegion`.
    `end`     | The end point of the `BracketRegion`.

    **Methods**:

    `#!py def size(self)`
    : 
        Returns size of region

    `#!py def move(self, begin_pt, end_pt)`
    : 
        Returns a new `BracketRegion` object with the points moved to the specified position.

        **Parameters**:

        Parameter  | Description
        ---------- | -----------
        `begin_pt` | Starting point.
        `end_pt`   | End Point.

        **Returns**:

        Return          | Description
        --------------  | -----------
        `BracketRegion` | `BracketRegion` with new starting and ending points.

    `#!py def to_region(self)`
    : 
        Converts `BracketRegion` to a `SublimeRegion`.

        **Returns**:

        Return          | Description
        --------------- |------------
        `SublimeRegion` | A Sublime Region.

If needed, bracket plugins can be imported into each other in order to reuse functionality, but because they are not in Python's path, you need to use the special import method.

`#!py def import_module(module, attribute=None)`
: 
    Imports a `bh_plugin` and returns the module or the module attribute if `attribute` is defined.

    **Parameters**:

    Parameter   | Description
    ----------- |------------
    `module`    | The desired module to import. For internal plugins, they are referenced by `bh_modules.<plugin name>`.  For custom plugins, you should use the folder path relative to `Packages`.  So if I had a plugin called `myplugin.py` in my `User/bh_modules` folder, I would use `User.bh_modules.myplugin`.
    `attribute` | The attribute to import from the module.

### Definition Plugins

These are plugins that are attached to the bracket definition and aid in processing the brackets.  These kinds of plugins have three methods you can provide: `post_match`, `compare`, and/or `validate`.

#### validate

`#!py def validate(name, bracket, bracket_size, bfr)`
: 
    `validate` is run before comparing the bracket to its corresponding opening or closing partner.  This is used to perform additional validation on a found bracket.  For example, lets say you have a bracket that is case sensitive.  BH uses a case insensitive search, so with validate, you can ensure the originally found bracket matches the desired case.

    **Parameters**:

    Parameter      | Description
    -------------- |------------
    `name`         | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.
    `bracket`      | The bracket region being validated.
    `bracket_side` | Opening (0) or closing (1) bracket.
    `bfr`          | The file buffer.

    **Returns**:

    Return  | Description |
    ------- |-------------|
    Boolean | Indicates whether the validation succeeded `True` or failed `False`. |

    Example: Should match closing tag `end` but not match `End`

    ```erlang
    case Foo of
        Guard1 -> ok;
        Guard2 -> End
    end
    ```

    Example (from `lowercase.py`):

    ```py
    def validate(name, bracket, bracket_side, bfr):
        """Check if bracket is lowercase."""

        return bfr[bracket.begin:bracket.end].islower()
    ```

#### compare

`#!py def compare(name, first, second, bfr)`
: 

    `compare` is run when comparing the opening bracket with the closing brackets.  This allows you to provide logic to accept or reject the pairing of an opening bracket with a closing bracket.  You should not change the text in the view during this operation.

    **Parameters**:

    Parameter | Description
    --------- |------------
    `name`    | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.
    `first`   | A bracket region for the opening bracket.
    `second`  | A bracket region for the closing bracket.
    `bfr`     | The file buffer.

    **Returns**:

    Return  | Description
    ------- | -----------
    Boolean | Indicating whether the the comparison yields a suitable match.

    Example (from `phphekywords.py`):

    ```python
    def compare(name, first, second, bfr):
        return "end" + bfr[first.begin:first.end].lower() == bfr[second.begin:second.end].lower()
    ```

#### post_match

`#!py def post_match(name, style, first, second, center, bfr, threshold)`
: 
    `post_match` is run after the brackets have been matched.  You can do things like alter the highlighting region and change the bracket_style if needed. You should not change the text in the view during this operation.

    **Parameters**:

    Parameter   | Description
    ----------- |------------
    `name`      | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.
    `style`     | The style definition name that is to be used to highlight the region.
    `first`     |  A bracket region for the opening bracket.
    `second`    | A bracket region for the closing bracket.
    `center`    | Position (point) of cursor (in retrospect, probably not the most intuitive name -- not sure why I named it this).
    `bfr`       | The file buffer.
    `threshold` | The calculated search window of the buffer that is being searched.

    **Returns**:

    Return          | Description
    --------------- |------------
    `BracketRegion` | Opening bracket region.
    `BracketRegion` | Closing bracket region.
    `style`         | The name of the style definition to use.

    Example (from `rubykeywords.py`):

    ```py
    import re


    def post_match(view, name, style, first, second, center, bfr, threshold):
        if first is not None:
            # Strip whitespace from the beginning of first bracket
            open_bracket = bfr[first.begin:first.end]
            if open_bracket != "do":
                m = re.match(r"^(\s*\b)[\w\W]*", open_bracket)
                if m:
                    first = first.move(first.begin + m.end(1), first.end)
        return first, second, style
    ```

    Example (snippet from `tags.py`)

    ```py
    def post_match(view, name, style, first, second, center, bfr, threshold):
        left, right = first, second
        threshold = [0, len(bfr)] if threshold is None else threshold
        tag_settings = sublime.load_settings("bh_core.sublime-settings")
        tag_mode = get_tag_mode(view, tag_settings.get("tag_mode", {}))
        tag_style = tag_settings.get("tag_style", "angle")
        bracket_style = style

        if first is not None and tag_mode is not None:
            matcher = TagMatch(view, bfr, threshold, first, second, center, tag_mode)
            left, right = matcher.match()
            if not matcher.no_tag:
                bracket_style = tag_style

        return left, right, bracket_style
    ```

#### highlighting

`#!py def highlighting(view, name, style, right)`
: 
    `highlighting` is the last hook that gets run.  This is at a point when BH no longer cares about what the *actual* bracket region is, so it is safe to modify it for highlighting purposes.  The view really shouldn't be modified here.

    **Parameters**:

    Parameter | Description
    --------- |------------
    `view`    | The current view containing brackets.
    `name`    | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.
    `style`   | The style definition name that is to be used to highlight the region.
    `left`    | A bracket region for the opening bracket (could be `None`).
    `right`   | A bracket region for the closing bracket (could be `None`).

    **Returns**:

    Return          | Description
    --------------- | -----------
    `BracketRegion` | Opening bracket region.
    `BracketRegion` | Closing bracket region.

    Example (snippet from `tags.py`)

    ```py
    def highlighting(view, name, style, left, right):
        """
        Highlight only the tag name.
        """
        if style == "tag":
            tag_name = '[\w\:\.\-]+'
            if left is not None:
                region = view.find(tag_name, left.begin)
                left = left.move(region.begin(), region.end())
            if right is not None:
                region = view.find(tag_name, right.begin)
                right = right.move(region.begin(), region.end())
        return left, right
    ```

### Run Instance Plugins

`Run instance` plugins are manually invoked bracket matching with an attached plugin. The plugin itself is executed after a match is made.  When defining a manually invoked BH command, either `bh_key` or `bh_async_key` should be used (key referring to key binding, but is also used for the menu and command palette).  It may be misleading as to what `bh_async_key` means, but it is mainly a workaround to launch BH keys from the command palette.  The command is kicked off asynchronously to ensure the palette closes before executing, but the BH command itself is still synchronous.

Example of run instance plugin getting called:

```js
// Go to left bracket
    {
        "caption": "BracketHighlighter: Jump to Left Bracket",
        "command": "bh_key",
        "args":
        {
            "lines" : true,
            "plugin":
            {
                "type": ["__all__"],
                "command": "bh_modules.bracketselect",
                "args": {"select": "left"}
            }
        }
    },
```

The `args` parameter is a dictionary.

Parameter        | Description
---------------- |------------
`lines`          | Show the number of lines between the matched brackets in the status bar.
`no_outside_adj` | This is a parameter used to tell the plugin to ignore the `bracket_outside_adjacent` setting.  This is by default used for the `bracketselect` commands to ignore outside adjacent matching so it can do expanding selections or jump to parents brackets.  The default is `false` when not defined, but it can be set to `true` or `null` in JSON (it would be `None` if defined directly in Python code).  When `null`, the value will be read from `ignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin` setting in the `bh_core.sublime-settings` file for convenient altering of the behavior.
`plugin`         | Configuration for the plugin to be used.

The `plugin` parameter is a dictionary that contains 3 arguments that define which plugin should get run, under which circumstance it is run, and with what parameters it is run with.

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`type`    | An array containing the bracket definition names that the plugin should be run on.  Use `__all__` for all bracket definitions.
`command` | The plugin to run.  For internal plugins, they are referenced by `bh_modules.<plugin name>`.  For custom plugins, you should use the folder path relative to `Packages`.  So if I had a plugin called `myplugin.py` in my `User/bh_modules` folder, I would use `User.bh_modules.myplugin`.
`args`    | A dictionary containing the arguments to feed into the plugin.


You create `run instance` plugins by deriving a class from the `BracketPluginCommand` class.  Then you provide a method called `plugin` that returns the class.

`#!py class BracketPluginCommand()`
: 

    **Attributes**:

    Attribute       | Description
    --------------- |------------
    `view`          | The sublime view containing the bracket (don't change this).
    `left`          | A bracket region for the opening bracket (can be changed).
    `right`         | A bracket region for the closing bracket (can be changed).
    `selection`     | An array containing the selection that triggered the match (can be changed).
    `refresh_match` | A plugin can set this to `true` if the plugin has moved the cursor in such a way that the current highlighted match is no longer valid.  This will cause BH to setup another match when idle. An example of this is in the `bracketselect` `bh_plugin`; the cursor can be moved outside the matching brackets requiring a refresh to match the parent when the command is complete.
    `nobracket`     | This was added mainly for sub-bracket matching (a bracket inside other brackets like round brackets in quotes/strings).  This is set to true if the plugin has caused both left and right brackets to be returned as `None` and it is not desired to fall back and match the parent.

    **Methods**:

    `#!py def run(edit, name, <args>)`
    : 

        **Parameters**:

        Parameter | Description
        --------- | -----------
        `edit`    | The sublime edit object.
        `name`    | The bracket definition being evaluated.

    Example (from `foldbracket.py`):

    ```python
    import BracketHighlighter.bh_plugin as bh_plugin
    import sublime


    class FoldBrackets(bh_plugin.BracketPluginCommand):
        def run(self, edit, name):
            content = sublime.Region(self.left.end, self.right.begin)
            new_content = [content]
            if content.size() > 0:
                if self.view.fold(content) == False:
                    new_content = self.view.unfold(content)
            self.selection = new_content


    def plugin():
        return FoldBrackets
    ```
