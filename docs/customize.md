# Customization {: .doctitle}
Tweaking BracketHighlighter.

---

## Overview
BH is extremely flexible and can be customized and extended to fit a user's needs.  The first step to customizing the existing rules and settings is to create a `bh_core.sublime-settings` in your `User` folder.  This is where the bracket and style rules and settings live.  By changing these settings, you can add support for new languages, or change the look of highlighting, and much more.

## Core Settings
Styles and colors will be discussed in greater depth in the [Configuring Highlight Style](#configuring-highlight-style) section.  But there are a number of general setting you can adjust to change how things look or work.  These settings are found in `bh_core.sublime-settings`.

## Visual Settings
These are the settings related to the visual appearance of BH.

### show_in_minimap
Shows highlighted brackets in the minimap.  This will work with all highlight styles except `underline`; `thin_underline` has no issues.

```js
    // Show brackets in the minimap.
    "show_in_minimap": false,
```

### show_unmatched
Displays a special highlight for brackets that cannot be matched.

```js
    // When only either the left or right bracket can be found
    // this defines if the unmatched bracket should be shown.
    "show_unmatched": true,
```

### show_unmatched_exceptions
List of languages in which the `show_unmatched` option logic will be reversed.

```js
    // Do the opposite of "show_unmatched" for the languages listed below
    "show_unmatched_exceptions": [],
```

### content_highlight_bar
An experimental setting which can enable the display of a vertical bar that extends from the line containing the opening bracket to the line with the closing bracket.  Takes a boolean `true` or `false`.  When [align_content_highlight_bar](#align_content_highlight_bar) is set to `false`, the bar will be shown on the first column regardless of indent level of the brackets.  When `align_content_highlight_bar` is set to `true`, the bar will be aligned at the bracket indent level.

```js
    // Experimental: Creates a visible bar at the beginning of all lines between
    // multiline bracket spans.
    "content_highlight_bar": false,
```

### align_content_highlight_bar
Modifies the behavior of [content_highlight_bar](#content-highlight-bar) and draws the vertical content bar at the indentation level of the highlighted bracket, but there are some limitations:

- The content bar cannot extend through an empty line unless the bar is on the first column.  This is a limitation of the Sublime API.  Empty lines will have cause a gap in the bar.

- The content bar will not be shown on a line where non-whitespace characters cross the bar.

```js
    // Experimental: Align the content highlight bar at the bracket indent level
    "align_content_highlight_bar": false,
```

### high_visibility_enabled_by_default
Enables high visibility mode by default.  High visibility mode highlights not only the bracket but the content between as well, but it is disabled by default and must be toggled on to be used.  This reverses the behavior and has it on by default. Takes a boolean `true` or `false`.

```js
    // Enable high visibility by default when sublime starts up
    "high_visibility_enabled_by_default": false,
```

### high_visibility_style
Modifies the styling of high visibility mode.  The available options are `solid`, `outline`, `underline`, `thin_underline`, `squiggly`, and `stippled`.

```js
    // High visibility style and color for high visibility mode
    "high_visibility_style": "outline",
```


### high_visibility_color
Modifies the high visibility color.  There are three types of settings you can use:

- `__default__` is a special reserved value which will use the color set in `bracket_styles`.  See [Configuring Highlight Style](#configuring-highlight-style) for more info.

- `__bracket__` is a special reserved value which will inherit the defined color of the highlighted bracket.

- Any valid scope found in your color scheme.

```js
    // Color for high visibility mode
    "high_visibility_color": "__bracket__",
```

## Behavioral Settings
These settings affect the matching behavior.

### match_only_adjacent
Causes BH to only match and highlight brackets when the cursor is adjacent to a bracket.

```js
    // Match brackets only when the cursor is touching the inside of the bracket
    "match_only_adjacent": false,
```

### bracket_outside_adjacent
Augments the matching behavior and will trigger matching when the cursor is adjacent to a cursor on the outside (not between the brackets).

```js
    // Outside adjacent bracket matching
    "bracket_outside_adjacent": true,
```
### ignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin
Ignores the [bracket_outside_adjacent](#bracket_outside_adjacent) setting when running a plugin **if** the plugin sets `no_outside_adj` to `null` (`null` for JSON or `None` in Python).

```js
    // When "bracket_outside_adjacet" is set, and a plugin command explicitly sets
    // "no_outside_adj" "None" instead of "true" or the default "false",
    // this value will be used.
    "ignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin": true,
```

### bracket_string_escape_mode
Depending on the setting, BH will either match sub-brackets inside strings with traditional string escape logic, or will match sub-brackets in strings with regex escape logic.  Takes a string value of either `regex` or `string`.

```js
    // Set mode for string escapes to ignore (regex|string)
    "bracket_string_escape_mode": "string",
```

### search_threshold
Sets the search threshold.  The search threshold determines how many characters BH will search through to find matching brackets before giving up.  This setting only affects auto-matching and not on-demand calls from the command palette and menu. By default, this value is very conservative and can be increased.  Keep in mind that a very large values may impact performance.

```js
    // Character threshold to search
    "search_threshold": 5000,
```

### ignore_threshold
Causes [search_threshold's](#search_threshold) limit to be ignored.  It is not advised to use this as very large files may cause a noticeable performance hit, but has been made available due to a number of requests.

```js
    // Ignore threshold
    "ignore_threshold": false,
```

### auto_selection_threshold
A numerical value which controls the maximum number of simultaneous auto-matched brackets that are allowed.  This setting will not be considered when running on-demand calls via the command palette or menu.

```js
    // Set max number of multi-select brackets that will be searched automatically
    "auto_selection_threshold" : 10,
```

### kill_highlight_on_threshold
Completely kills highlighting when [auto_selection_threshold](#auto_selection_threshold).  When disabled, BH will just highlight up to the threshold limit.

```js
    // Enable this to completely kill highlighting if "auto_selection_threshold"
    // is exceeded.  Default is to highlight up to the "auto_selection_threshold".
    "kill_highlight_on_threshold": true,
```

### no_multi_select_icons
Disables gutter icons when doing multiple selections.

```js
    // Disable gutter icons when doing multi-select
    "no_multi_select_icons": false,
```

## Tag Plugin Settings
Tag settings found in `bh_tag.sublime-settings`.

### tag_style
Sets the highlight style for the tag plugin.  The string value should correspond to a style entry in `bracket_styles`.  See [Configuring Highlight Style](#configuring-highlight-style) for more info.

```js
    // Style to use for matched tags
    "tag_style": "tag",
```

### tag_scope_exclude
Excludes certain scopes from being evaluated when searching for tags.

```js
    // Scopes to exclude from tag searches
    "tag_scope_exclude": ["string", "comment"],
```

### tag_mode
A directory that contains a dictionary of three modes: `xhtml`, `html`, `cfml`.  Each mode tweaks the tag matching for the respective mode.  Each entry in the dictionary consists of a list of languages that should be evaluated in that mode.

```js
    // Determine which style of tag-matching to use in which syntax
    "tag_mode": {
        "xhtml": ["XML"],
        "html": ["HTML", "HTML 5", "PHP"],
        "cfml": ["HTML+CFML", "ColdFusion", "ColdFusionCFC"]
    }
```

### self_closing_tags
A list of tag names that will be evaluated as self closing.

```js
    // Self closing HTML tags
    "self_closing_tags": [
        "colgroup", "dd", "dt", "li", "options", "p", "td",
        "tfoot", "th", "thead", "tr"
    ],
```

### single_tags
A list of tag names that never have a closing tag.

```js
    // Tags that never have a closing
    "single_tags": [
        "area", "base", "basefont", "br", "col", "embed", "frame", "hr",
        "img", "input", "isindex", "keygen", "link", "meta", "param",
        "source", "track", "wbr"
    ]
```

## Swap Brackets Plugin Settings
Swappable brackets for a given language can be defined in `bh_swapping.sublime-settings`.  Swap rules are found under the key `swapping` where `swapping` is an array of language swap rules.

```js
    "swapping": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "language_list": ["C++", "C"],
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "entries": [
                {"name": "C/C++: #if", "brackets": ["#if ${BH_SEL}", "#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #if, #else", "brackets": ["#if${BH_SEL}", "#else\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #if, #elif", "brackets": ["#if${BH_SEL}", "#elif ${BH_TAB:/* CONDITION */}\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifdef", "brackets": ["#ifdef${BH_SEL}", "#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifdef, #else", "brackets": ["#ifdef${BH_SEL}", "#else\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifndef", "brackets": ["#ifndef${BH_SEL}", "#endif"]},
                {"name": "C/C++: #ifndef, #else", "brackets": ["#ifndef${BH_SEL}", "#else\n${BH_TAB:/* CODE */}\n#endif"]}
            ]
        }
    ]
```

Each language rule contains the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| enabled | bool | Specifies if the rule is enabled. |
| language_list | [string] | An array of languages. |
| language_filter | string | A string that specifies if the `language_list` is either a `whitelist` or `blacklist`. |
| entries | [dict] | An array of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes a type of bracket that can be swapped to. |

The `entries` key is used to define the related bracket swap rules for the given langauge.  Each entry represents a bracket you can swap to.

| Entry | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| name | string | The name of the entry as it will be seen in the command palette. |
| brackets | [string] | An array consisting of a string that represents the opening bracket and a string that represents the closing bracket. |

Within the `brackets` key, you can specify the where the cursor(s) will appear by using `${BH_SEL}`  If you would like the selection to display text as a hint to what a user should enter in the selection, you can use `${BH_SEL:optional text}`.  You can also define tab stops that a user can tab through and enter text.  The tab stop syntax is `${BH_TAB}`.  You can also define optional text within a tab stop to give the user a hint of what should be entered at the tab stop using the following syntax: `${BH_TAB:optional text}`.

## Wrap Brackets Plugin Settings
Wrapping brackets for a given language can be defined in `bh_wrapping.sublime-settings`.  Wrap rules are found under the key `wrapping` where `wrapping` is an array of language wrap rules.

```js
    "wrapping": [
        {
            "enabled": true,
            "language_list": ["Plain text"],
            "language_filter": "blacklist",
            "entries": [
                {"name": "{} Curly", "brackets": ["{", "}${BH_SEL}"], "insert_style": ["inline", "block", "indent_block"]}
            ]
        }
    ]
```

Each language rule contains the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| enabled | bool | Specifies if the rule is enabled. |
| language_list | [string] | An array of languages. |
| language_filter | string | A string that specifies if the `language_list` is either a `whitelist` or `blacklist`. |
| entries | [dict] | An array of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes a type of bracket that can be used to wrap the selection. |

The `entries` key is used to define the related bracket warp rules for the given langauge.  Each entry represents a bracket you can wrap the selection with.

| Entry | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| name | string | The name of the entry as it will be seen in the command palette. |
| brackets | [string] | An array consisting of a string that represents the opening bracket and a string that represents the closing bracket. |
| insert_style | [string] | An array consisting of allowed insertion styles.  Allowed insertion styles are: `inline`, `block`, and `indent_block`.  Default is `#!js ['inline']`. |

Within the `brackets` key, you can specify where the cursor(s) will appear by using `${BH_SEL}`  If you would like the selection to display text as a hint to what a user should enter in the selection, you can use `${BH_SEL:optional text}`. You can also define tab stops that a user can tab through and enter text.  The tab stop syntax is `${BH_TAB}`.  You can also define optional text within a tab stop to give the user a hint of what should be entered in at the tab stop using the following syntax: `${BH_TAB:optional text}`.

## Configuring Brackets
BH has been written to allow users to define any brackets they would like to have highlighted.  There are two kinds of brackets you can define: `scope_brackets` which search the file for scope regions and then use regex to test for opening and closing brackets, and `brackets` which use regex to find opening and closing brackets.  `brackets` type rules should usually be the preferred type.  `scope_brackets` are usually used for brackets whose opening and closing are the same and are not easily distinguishable from one another by regex; scope brackets must be contained in a continuous scope region like string for quotes etc.

BH uses a wrapper around Python's re regex library to add support for additional back references.  See the [Extended Regex Guide](./extended-regex.md#extended-regex-guide).

!!! tip "Tip"
    Brackets can be modified, or even added, without copying the entire bracket rule list to the user settings.  See [Bracket Rule Management](#bracket-rule-management) for more info.

### Configuring Brackets Rules
Brackets are defined under `brackets` in `bh_core.sublime-settings`.

`angle` and `curly` brackets will be used as an example (not all options may be shown in these examples):

```javascript
        {
            "name": "angle",
            "open": "(<)",
            "close": "(>)",
            "style": "angle",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment", "keyword.operator"],
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["HTML", "HTML 5", "XML", "PHP", "HTML+CFML", "ColdFusion", "ColdFusionCFC"],
            "plugin_library": "bh_modules.tags",
            "enabled": true
        },
        {
            "name": "curly",
            "open": "(\\{)",
            "close": "(\\})",
            "style": "curly",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment"],
            "scope_exclude_exceptions": ["string.other.math.block.environment.latex"],
            "language_filter": "blacklist",
            "language_list": ["Plain text"],
            "find_in_sub_search": "true",
            "ignore_string_escape": true,
            "enabled": true
        },
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| name | The name of the bracket (should be unique) |
| open | Defines the opening bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present) |
| close | Defines the closing bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present) |
| style | Name of style definition to be used to highlight the brackets.  See `Configuring Bracket Styles` for more info. |
| scope_exclude | Scopes where the opening and closing brackets should be ignored. |
| language_filter | This works in conjunction with `language_list`.  It specifies whether `language_list` is a `blacklist` or `whitelist`. |
| language_list | An array of tmLanguage file names that should be avoided or included for highlighting.  Looks to `language_filter` to determine if avoidance or inclusion is used. |
| enabled | Disable or enable rule. |
| scope_exclude_exceptions&nbsp;(optional) | Used to ignore excluding of sub scopes such as in the curly example above where `string` is excluded, but not `string.other.math.block.environment.latex`. |
| plugin_library&nbsp;(optional) | Defines plugin to use for determining matches (see Bracket Plugin API for more info on matching plugins). |
| find_in_sub_search&nbsp;(optional) | This rule should be included when doing sub bracket matching in `scope_brackets` (like finding round brackets between quotes etc.).  The setting must be as string and can be either (true|false|only); only means this bracket is only matched as a sub bracket of a `scope_bracket`. |
| ignore_string_escape&nbsp;(optional) | Do not ignore sub brackets found in strings and regex when escaped, but use internal escape logic to determine if the brackets should be ignored based on whether regex or string escape mode is set. |

### Configuring Scope Brackets Rules
Scope Brackets are defined under `scope_brackets` in `bh_core.sublime-settings`.

`py_single_quote` bracket will be used as an example (not all options are shown in this example):

```javascript
        {
            "name": "py_single_quote",
            "open": "u?r?((?:'')?')",
            "close": "((?:'')?')",
            "style": "single_quote",
            "scopes": ["string"],
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["Python"],
            "sub_bracket_search": "true",
            "enabled": true
        },
```

| Parameters | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| name | The name of the bracket (should be unique). |
| open | Defines the opening bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present). |
| close | Defines the closing bracket (one and only one capturing group must be present). |
| style | Name of style definition to be used to highlight the brackets.  See `Configuring Bracket Styles` for more info. |
| scopes | Scope that should be searched to find the opening and closing brackets. |
| language_filter | This works in conjunction with `language_list`.  It specifies whether `language_list` is a `blacklist` or `whitelist`. |
| language_list | An array of tmLanguage file names that should be avoided or included for highlighting.  Looks to `language_filter` to determine if avoidance or inclusion is used. |
| sub_bracket_search | Should this scope bracket also search for sub brackets (like curly brackets in strings etc.). |
| enabled | Disable or enable rule. |
| plugin_library&nbsp;(optional) | Defines plugin to use for determining matches (see Bracket Plugin API for more info on matching plugins). |

### Bracket Rule Management
In the past, BracketHighlighter required a user to copy the entire bracket list to the user `bh_core.sublime-settings` file.  This was a cumbersome requirement that also punished a user because if they did this, they wouldn't automatically get updates to the rules as all the rules were now overridden by the user's settings file.

BracketHighlighter now lets you add or modify existing rules without overriding the entire rule set, or even the entire target rule.  Let's say you have a custom language you want to have on your machine. Now, you can simply add it to one of the two settings arrays: "user_scope_brackets" and "user_brackets":

```js
    "user_scope_brackets": [],
    "user_brackets": [
        {
            "name": "mylang",
            "open": "^\\s*\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\b",
            "close": "\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\b",
            "style": "default",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment"],
            "plugin_library": "User.bh_modules.mylangkeywords",
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["mylang"],
            "enabled": true
        }
    ],
```

Let's say you want to modify an existing rule, maybe just tweak the language list, all you have to do is use the same name and the item you want to change. Only that attribute will be overridden:

```js
    "user_brackets": [
        // Angle
        {
            "name": "angle",
            "language_list": [
                "HTML", "HTML 5", "XML", "PHP", "HTML (Rails)",
                "HTML (Jinja Templates)", "HTML (Twig)", "HTML+CFML",
                "ColdFusion", "ColdFusionCFC", "laravel-blade",
                "Handlebars", "AngularJS",
                "SomeNewLanguage" // <--- New language
            ]
        }
    ],
```

Let's say you want to insert a new rule between two rules. You can turn on debug mode and call the `BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key` then select position to see the current rule order and their position index.  To turn on Debug mode, just add `"debug_enable": true` to your user settings file.

Example of `BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key` output:

```js
[
    [
        {"name": "curly", "position": 0},
        {"name": "round", "position": 1},
        {"name": "square", "position": 2},
        {"name": "html", "position": 3},
        {"name": "cfml", "position": 4},
        {"name": "php_angle", "position": 5},
        {"name": "angle", "position": 6},
        {"name": "cssedit_groups", "position": 7},
        {"name": "ruby_embedded_html", "position": 8},
        {"name": "ruby", "position": 9},
        {"name": "c_compile_switch", "position": 10},
        {"name": "php_keywords", "position": 11},
        {"name": "erlang", "position": 12},
        {"name": "bash", "position": 13},
        {"name": "fish", "position": 14},
        {"name": "mylang", "position": 15}
    ],
    [
        {"name": "py_single_quote", "position": 0},
        {"name": "py_double_quote", "position": 1},
        {"name": "single_quote", "position": 2},
        {"name": "double_quote", "position": 3},
        {"name": "jsregex", "position": 4},
        {"name": "perlregex", "position": 5},
        {"name": "rubyregex", "position": 6},
        {"name": "mditalic", "position": 7},
        {"name": "mdbold", "position": 8}
    ]
]
```

Then you can specify the position you want to insert at using the `position` key:

```js
    "user_scope_brackets": [],
    "user_brackets": [
        {
            "name": "mylang",
            "position": 4, // <-- New position
            "open": "^\\s*\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\b",
            "close": "\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\b",
            "style": "default",
            "scope_exclude": ["string", "comment"],
            "plugin_library": "User.bh_modules.mylangkeywords",
            "language_filter": "whitelist",
            "language_list": ["mylang"],
            "enabled": true
        }
    ],
```

And if you run the debug command again, you will see that the position has changed:

```js
        {"name": "curly", "position": 0},
        {"name": "round", "position": 1},
        {"name": "square", "position": 2},
        {"name": "html", "position": 3},
        {"name": "trex", "position": 4}, // <-- New position
        {"name": "cfml", "position": 5},
        {"name": "php_angle", "position": 6},
```

This can be used to adjust the position of default rules from your user settings as seen in the overrides above.

So, unless you are forking BH to pull request a change to the default rules, you can now modify the rules in just these two settings without copying or touching the default rules. This will allow you to make changes, but still receive new updated rules.

```js
    "user_scope_brackets": [],
    "user_brackets": [],
```

## Configuring Highlight Style
Each bracket definition (described in `Configuring Scope Brackets` and `Configuring Brackets`) has a `style` setting that you can assign a specific style to.  The name of the style corresponds to a style definition.  Style definitions are defined under `bracket_styles` in `bh_core.sublime-settings`.

There are two special style definitions whose names are reserved: `default` and `unmatched`, but you can configure them.  All other custom style definitions follow the same pattern.  You can look at `curly` below and compare to the special style definitions; the format is the same.  All custom styles follow this pattern.  See description below:

```javascript
        // "default" style defines attributes that
        // will be used for any style that does not
        // explicitly define that attribute.  So if
        // a style does not define a color, it will
        // use the color from the "default" style.
        "default": {
            "icon": "dot",
            "color": "brackethighlighter.default",
            "style": "underline"
        },

        // This particular style is used to highlight
        // unmatched bracket pairs.  It is a special
        // style.
        "unmatched": {
            "icon": "question",
            // "color": "brackethighlighter.unmatched",
            "style": "outline"
        },
        // User defined region styles
        "curly": {
            "icon": "curly_bracket"
            // "color": "brackethighlighter.curly",
            // "style": "underline"
        },
        "tag": {
            "icon": "tag",
            // "endpoints": true,
            // "color": "brackethighlighter.tag",
            "style": "outline"
        },
```

|Parameter | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| icon | Icon to show in gutter. Available options are: `angle`, `round`, `curly`, `square`, `tag`, `star`, `dot`, `bookmark`, `question`, `quote`, `double_quote`, `single_quote`, `single_quote_offset`, `double_quote_offset`, `none`. |
| color | Scope to define color. |
| style | Highlight style.  Available options are: `solid`, `outline`, `underline`, `none`.  ST3 has additional styles: `thin_underline`, `squiggly`, `stippled`. |
| endpoint | Boolean to highlight just the beginning and end of bracket. This is useful for things like tags where it may be distracting highlighting the entire tag. |

As shown in the example above, if an option is omitted, it will use the setting in `default`.  So `curly`, in this example, defines `icon`, but will use `default` for the `color` and `style`.

To customize the color for `curly` you can create your own custom scope.

Add this to your color scheme:
```xml
        <dict>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>Bracket Curly</string>
            <key>scope</key>
            <string>brackethighlighter.curly</string>
            <key>settings</key>
            <dict>
                <key>foreground</key>
                <string>#CC99CC</string>
            </dict>
        </dict>
```

And then use the scope:
```javascript
        "curly": {
            "icon": "curly_bracket"
            "color": "brackethighlighter.curly",
            // "style": "underline"
        },
```

### My personal configurations

If you are curious about my personal configuration, here it is. The color scheme I use is from my [Aprosopo theme](https://github.com/facelessuser/Aprosopo).

!!! note "Note"
    If a scope is not defined, it won't change the color. For instance, below I assign the hash rule for C/C++ preprocessors conditionals to `brackethighlighter.c_define`, but I don't have `brackethighlighter.c_define` in my theme `<dict>`. So it will look like the default color for this theme, white.


**My personal conf: bh_core.sublime-settings**

```javascript
// Define region highlight styles
"bracket_styles": {

## Bracket Plugin API
There are two kinds of plugins that can be written `definition` plugins (plugins attached to bracket definitions via the `plugin_library` option) or `run instance` plugins (plugins that are that are fed directly into the BracketHighligher command via the command parameter `plugin`).

Bracket plugins use `BracketRegions`.

class BracketRegion(begin_pt, end_pt)
: 
    `BracketRegions` are simple objects containing a begin pt and end pt of a bracket.

    **Parameters**:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | begin_pt | Starting point. |
    | end_pt | Ending point. |

    **Attributes**:

    | Attribute | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | begin | The start pt of the BracketRegion. |
    | end | The end pt of the BracketRegion. |

    **Methods**:

    def size(self)
    : 
        Returns size of region

    def move(self, begin_pt, end_pt)
    : 
        Returns a new BracketRegion object with the points moved to the specified position.

        **Parmenters**:

        | Parameter | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | begin_pt  | Starting point. |
        | end_pt | End Point. |

        **Returns**:

        | Return | Description |
        |--------|-------------|
        | BracketRegion | BracketRegion with new starting and ending points |

    def to_region(self)
    : 
        Converts BracketRegion to a SublimeRegion

        **Returns**:

        | Return | Description |
        |--------|-------------|
        | SublimeRegion | A Sublime Region. |

### 'Definition' Plugins
These are plugins that are attached to the bracket definition and aid in processing the brackets.  These kinds of plugins have three methods you can provide: `post_match`, `compare`, and/or `validate`.

#### validate
def validate(name, bracket, bracket_size, bfr)
: 
    `validate` is run before comparing the bracket to its corresponding opening or closing partner.  This is used to perform additional validation on a found bracket.  For example, lets say you have a bracket that is case sensitive.  BH uses a case insensitive search, so with validate, you can ensure the originally found bracket matches the desired case.

    **Parameters**:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | name | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated. |
    | bracket | The bracket region being validated. |
    | bracket_side | Opening (0) or closing (1) bracket. |
    | bfr | The file buffer. |

    **Returns**:

    | Return | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Boolean | indicates whether the validation succeeded (True) or failed (False). |

    Example: Should match closing tag `end` but not match `End`

    ```erlang
    case Foo of
        Guard1 -> ok;
        Guard2 -> End
    end
    ```

    Example (from erlangcase.py):

    ```python
    def validate(name, bracket, bracket_side, bfr):
        text = bfr[bracket.begin:bracket.end]
        return text.lower() == text

    ```

#### compare
def compare(name, first, second, bfr)
: 

    `compare` is run when comparing the opening bracket with closing brackets.  This allows you to provide logic to accept or reject the pairing of an opening bracket with a closing bracket.  You should not change the text in the view during this operation.

    **Paramters**:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | name | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated. |
    | first | A bracket region for the opening bracket. |
    | second | A bracket region for the closing bracket. |
    | bfr | The file buffer. |

    **Returns**:

    | Return | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Boolean | Indicating whether the the comparison yields a suitable match. |

    Example (from phphekywords.py):
    ```python
    def compare(name, first, second, bfr):
        return "end" + bfr[first.begin:first.end].lower() == bfr[second.begin:second.end].lower()
    ```

#### post_match
def post_match(name, style, first, second, center, bfr, threshold)
: 
    `post_match` is run after the brackets have been matched.  You can do things like alter the highlighting region and change the bracket_style if needed. You should not change the text in the view during this operation.

    **Parameters**:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | name | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated. |
    | style | The style definition name that is to be used to highlight the region. |
    | first |  A bracket region for the opening bracket. |
    | second | A bracket region for the closing bracket. |
    | center | Position (pt) of cursor (in retrospect, probably not the most intuitive name; not sure why I named it this). |
    | bfr | The file buffer. |
    | threshold | The calculated search window of the buffer that is being searched. |

    **Returns**:

    | Return | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | BracketRegion | Opening bracket region. |
    | BracketRegion | Closing bracket region. |
    | style | The name of the style definition to use. |

    Example (from rubykeywords.py):
    ```python
    import re


    def post_match(view, name, style, first, second, center, bfr, threshold):
        if first is not None:
            # Strip whitespace from the beginning of first bracket
            open_bracket = bfr[first.begin:first.end]
            if open_bracket != "do":
                m = re.match(r"^(\s*\b)[\w\W]*", open_bracket)
                if m:
                    first = first.move(first.begin + m.end(1), first.end)
        return first, second, style
    ```

    Example (snippet from tags.py)
    ```python
    def post_match(view, name, style, first, second, center, bfr, threshold):
        left, right = first, second
        threshold = [0, len(bfr)] if threshold is None else threshold
        tag_settings = sublime.load_settings("bh_core.sublime-settings")
        tag_mode = get_tag_mode(view, tag_settings.get("tag_mode", {}))
        tag_style = tag_settings.get("tag_style", "angle")
        bracket_style = style

        if first is not None and tag_mode is not None:
            matcher = TagMatch(view, bfr, threshold, first, second, center, tag_mode)
            left, right = matcher.match()
            if not matcher.no_tag:
                bracket_style = tag_style

        return left, right, bracket_style
    ```

#### highlighting
def highlighting(view, name, style, right)
: 
    `highlighting` is the last hook that gets run.  This is at a point when BH no longer cares about what the *actual* bracket region is, so it is safe to modify it for highlighting purposes.  The view really shouldn't be modified here.

    **Parameters**:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | view | The current view containing brackets. |
    | name | The name of the bracket definition being evaluated. |
    | style | The style definition name that is to be used to highlight the region. |
    | left | A bracket region for the opening bracket (could be `None`). |
    | right | A bracket region for the closing bracket (could be `None`). |

    **Returns**:

    | Return | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | BracketRegion | Opening bracket region. |
    | BracketRegion | Closing bracket region. |

    Example (snippet from tags.py)

    ```python
    def highlighting(view, name, style, left, right):
        """
        Highlight only the tag name.
        """
        if style == "tag":
            tag_name = '[\w\:\.\-]+'
            if left is not None:
                region = view.find(tag_name, left.begin)
                left = left.move(region.begin(), region.end())
            if right is not None:
                region = view.find(tag_name, right.begin)
                right = right.move(region.begin(), region.end())
        return left, right
    ```

### 'Run Instance' Plugins
`Run instance` plugins are manually invoked bracket matching with an attached plugin.  
The plugin itself is executed after a match is made.  When defining a manually invoked BH command, either `bh_key` or `bh_async_key` should be used (key referring to key binding, but is also used for the menu and command palette).  It may be misleading as to what `bh_async_key` means, but it is mainly a workaround to launch BH keys from the command palette.  The command is kicked off asynchronously to ensure the palette closes before executing, but the BH command itself is still synchronous.

Example of run instance plugin getting called:
```javascript
// Go to left bracket
    {
        "caption": "BracketHighlighter: Jump to Left Bracket",
        "command": "bh_key",
        "args":
        {
            "lines" : true,
            "plugin":
            {
                "type": ["__all__"],
                "command": "bh_modules.bracketselect",
                "args": {"select": "left"}
            }
        }
    },
```

The `args` parameter is a dictionary.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| lines     | Show the number of lines between the matched brackets in the status bar. |
| no_outside_adj | This is a parameter used to tell the plugin to ignore the `bracket_outside_adjacent` setting.  This is by default used for the `bracketselect` commands to ignore outside adjacent matching so it can do expanding selections or jump to parents brackets.  The default is `false` when not defined, but it can be set to `true` or `null` in JSON (it would be `None` if defined directly in Python code).  When `null`, the value will be read from `ignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin` setting in the `bh_core.sublime-settings` file for convenient altering of the behavior. |
| plugin    | Configuration for the plugin to be used. |

The `plugin` parameter is a dictionary that contains 3 arguments that define which plugin should get run, under which circumstance it is run, and with what parameters it is run with.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| type | An array containing the bracket definition names that the plugin should be run on.  Use `__all__` for all bracket definitions. |
| command | The plugin to run.  For internal plugins, they are referenced by `bh_modules.<plugin name>`.  For custom plugins, you should use the folder path relative to `Packages`.  So if I had a plugin called `myplugin.py` in my `User` folder, I would use `User.myplugin`. |
| args | A dictionary containing the arguments to feed into the plugin. |


You create `run instance` plugins by deriving a class from the `BracketPluginCommand` class.  Then you provide a method called `plugin` that returns the class.

class BracketPluginCommand()
: 

    **Attributes**:

    | Attribute | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | view | The sublime view containing the bracket (don't change this). |
    | left | A bracket region for the opening bracket (can be changed). |
    | right | A bracket region for the closing bracket (can be changed). |
    | selection | An array containing the selection that triggered the match (can be changed). |
    | refresh_match | A plugin can set this to true if the plugin has moved the cursor in such a way that the current highlighted match is no longer valid.  This will cause BH to setup another match when idle. An example of this is in the `bracketselect` bh_plugin; the cursor can be moved outside the matching brackets requiring a refresh to match the parent when the command is complete. |
    | nobracket | This was added mainly for sub-bracket matching (a bracket inside other brackets like round brackets in quotes/strings).  This is set to true if the plugin has caused both left and right brackets to be returned as `None` and it is not desired to fall back and match the parent. |

    **Methods**:

    def run(edit, name, &lt;args&gt;)
    : 

        **Parameters**:

        | Parameter | Description |
        |--------|-------------|
        | edit | The sublime edit object. |
        | name | The bracket definition being evaluated. |

    Example (from foldbracket.py):
    ```python
    import BracketHighlighter.bh_plugin as bh_plugin
    import sublime


    class FoldBrackets(bh_plugin.BracketPluginCommand):
        def run(self, edit, name):
            content = sublime.Region(self.left.end, self.right.begin)
            new_content = [content]
            if content.size() > 0:
                if self.view.fold(content) == False:
                    new_content = self.view.unfold(content)
            self.selection = new_content


    def plugin():
        return FoldBrackets
    ```
