# BracketHighlighter
Bracket Highlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `""`, `''`, `#!xml <tag></tag>`, and even custom brackets.

This was originally forked from pyparadigm's _SublimeBrackets_ and _SublimeTagmatcher_ (both are no longer available).  I forked this to fix some issues I had and to add some features I had wanted.  I also wanted to improve the efficiency of the matching.

Moving forward, I have thrown away all of the code and have completely rewritten the entire code base to allow for a more flexibility, faster, and more feature rich experience.
